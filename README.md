# tpa-demo-app-react-jsx
###**Overview**

This boilerplate will make it easy for you to [start developing](http://dev.wix.com/) your Wix app. 
The project is already set up with a widget component and its App settings panel.

Most apps have a server side, but to keep it simple, we’ll focus only on the client side.

###**Features**
* Uses the official Wix UI-lib and [UI controls](http://dev.wix.com/docs/ui-lib/ui-controls/)
* Demo implementation of the app’s interaction with its settings panel 
* Option to use plain CSS (we use SASS by default)
* Updated with the latest version of [Wix SDK](http://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/using-the-sdk/)

###**Getting started**
Before you start - get [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Generate the app:

1. Clone our starter template
`git clone git@github.com:wix/tpa-demo-app-react-jsx.git`
2. Navigate to your project folder
`cd tpa-demo-app-react-jsx/`
3. Install npm
`npm install`
4. Run build
`npm run build`
5. Run the app
`npm start`
This will run a webserver on your local host. You can now view your app in your browser: http://localhost:3000/

###**Internationalisation**
The entire app supports dates formating, numbers, and strings, including pluralization and handling translations, using [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl)
#### Adding new locale
Add comma separated locales to environment variable `WIX_TPA_LOCALES`
Example:
* for development `WIX_TPA_LOCALES=en,ru npm run start`
* for deploying `WIX_TPA_LOCALES=en,ru npm run build`

There is no need to do any importing or preloading, it is served automatically

#### Translating messages (strings)
Each app (`src/settings` and `src/widget`) has `lang` dir inside.
`en.json` will be automatically added to this directory (task: build:langs)
1. Copy and rename `en.json` to desired locale name e.g. `ru.json`
2. Translate content of `ru.json`
See `src/settings/lang/README.md` for messages syntax

#### Language detection
Currently language is defined by browser (first value of `navigator.languages`)

###**Registering the App**

1. Follow the registration guide to create a new app.
2. Add a Widget endpoint:
  * Endpoint URL with the following URL:http://localhost:3000/widget.html
  * Set the width to 300px and height to 400px.
3. Set the App Setting URL to: 
  * http://localhost:3000/settings.html
  * Set the height (up to 578px). 
4. Save your app.
